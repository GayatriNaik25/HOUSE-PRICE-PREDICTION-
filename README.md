# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to predict house prices based on various features using Machine Learning algorithms. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a house given certain features like the number of rooms, the area, the location, and other related factors.

The project uses the **Boston Housing Dataset** from Scikit-learn for this task, but can easily be adapted to use any real estate dataset. The model is built using **Linear Regression**, though other algorithms can be implemented and compared to achieve better performance.

## Key Features:
- **Data Exploration**: Understanding the relationship between different features and the house prices.
- **Preprocessing**: Preparing the dataset by cleaning, handling missing values, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Building and training a machine learning model to predict house prices.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ².
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the predicted vs actual prices and exploring feature importance

## Dataset:
This project uses the **Boston Housing Dataset**, which is a standard dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains information on various features that influence house prices such as:

## Libraries Used:
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and dataset loading
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations
